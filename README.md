With this user-friendly console application, employers can easily view a comprehensive list of all employees within their organization. The app enables seamless addition of new employees, allowing employers to continuously add individuals to the roster. It also provides the flexibility to exit out of the add new employee prompt whenever needed.

Employers can quickly locate employees based on their Social Security Number (SSN), ensuring easy access to specific employee details.

Finally the ability to export or import txt file locally
